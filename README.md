# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I built this webpage as a way for me to learn basic html, css, git and JavaScript skills, driven by my desire to always be learning and growing. It is designed to help me organize my notes on these topics in order to better understand the prework assignments. It taught me how to use git and how to write rudimentary code in JavaScript.
